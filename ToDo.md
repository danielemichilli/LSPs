BUGS:
- High-DM astropysical pulses are removed (es. L199854_SAP0_BEAM72)

PLOT:
- Histogram bins smaller
- Histogram bins logarithmic or plot non logarithmic
- Remove time spans affected by RFI in general plot
- Histogram also for only pulses brighter than threshold

OUTPUT:
- Folder with general best plots

ANALYSIS:
- Better time alignment
- Probably better to join the first 3 pools together
- Add filter duration/sigma 
- Better study parameters of grouping
  - Better study filter values
- Substitute duration filter with downfact filter
- Alert for pulsars (more than x pulses at one DM, more than y pulses brighter than S in one DM)
- Pulse spectra

GENERAL
- Write Readme
- Re-write Installation
